     * Which of the following is correct about a resoure class that can be detected inside the try-with-resources statement?
     *
     * The requirement is that a resource class implements AutoCloseable, a supertype of Closeable.
     * The close method of AutoCloseable throws Exception, and overriding methods can only throw exceptions that are the same type or subtypes of the exception thrown by the override methods.
     * A subtype's method cannot have  more restricted scope than its overridden method defined in a super type.
     * The type of a variable declared in a resource specification must be a subtype of AutoCloseable.
